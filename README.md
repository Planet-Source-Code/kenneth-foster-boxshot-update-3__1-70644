### Description

This is my poor attempt at a boxshot program. My hopes are that someone will see just how poor it is and create a better looking one. Maybe even have features like shadow, reflection and rotate. Who knows.Code is real simple.Update: added left and right view and a smooth filter.

Update#2:Added shadow,preview,save as jpeg and add labels to front picture.

Update#3: Made some small changes just for Robert.Hopefully there are no bugs.
